## Description
Learning Matlab's functions to show the differences between original images and images after filtering with FIR filters.
FIR filters have several characteristics that make them ideal for image processing in the MATLAB environment:
<ul>
<li>FIR filters are easy to represent as matrices of coefficients.</li>
<li>Two-dimensional FIR filters are natural extensions of one-dimensional FIR filters.</li>
<li>There are several well-known, reliable methods for FIR filter design.</li>
<li>FIR filters are easy to implement.</li>
<li>FIR filters can be designed to have linear phase, which helps prevent distortion.</li>
</ul>
